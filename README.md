## Introduction
* This is a demo of how you can wrap your existing REST API inside a GraphQL API.
* Many popular REST APIs respond with data you may not need. I encountered some of the weather and movie APIs with a lot of unwanted data. 
* GraphQL overcomes this issue by allowing developers to selectively fetch only required data from the API.
* But not all organizations may want to switch from REST API, so an alternative option is to wrap your existing REST API inside GraphQL API.

## About this demo
* I have used the Current Weather Data of OpenWeatherMap API for the purpose of demonstration.
* The city is set to London by default.
* The following code shows the JSON response from the API.

## Running demo on a local device
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm i` command.
3. Generate your API key from [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/).
4. Create a .env file and add your key as shown in the example file.
5. Alternatively, you can add your key inside the `base_url` of schema.js.
6. Run the project using `npm start`.
